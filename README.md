[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LouisJackman/curses-firewall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LouisJackman/curses-firewall)

*NOTE: this project is dormant and was barely started, so don't bother looking
into it until development picks back up.*

A curses-based UI for generating and saving rulesets for iptables; well,
actually just a prototype of the UI for now.
